.SH DESCRIPTION
Invoke \fBpulseaudio-ctl\fP to adjust pulseaudio's volume level and mute status. Recommended usage is to map a call to a keypress for easy access. Many keyboards have keys specific to these particular actions and many if not all DE or WMs offer this ability natively. For example, xfce4 allows for this under Settings > Keyboard > Applicaton Shortcuts.
